    "Suppose you have a box which is devided into many boxes inside it.Now you want to draw a number 3 in that.To write a number you will colour the few boxes in a shape of three.After that some boxes are white in colour and boxes where your number is present changes to black.We can denote all the white boxes as 1 and black boxes as 0.\n",
